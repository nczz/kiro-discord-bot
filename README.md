# kiro-discord-bot

**A trainable AI agent that lives in Discord — binds to your codebase, remembers your rules, and gets smarter the more you use it.**

This bot connects Discord to [kiro-cli](https://kiro.dev) AI agents via the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) over stdio. It's not a chatbot — it's a full development agent workspace that grows with you.

### This is not a chatbot

Most AI bots start from zero every conversation. kiro-discord-bot is different:

🧠 **Remembers** — Persistent memory rules teach the agent your preferences, coding style, and project conventions. They stick across sessions forever.

⚡ **Adapts** — Flash memory lets you set session-scoped emphasis for the current task, then discard it cleanly.

📂 **Knows your code** — Each channel binds to a project directory. The agent reads/writes code, runs tests, manages infrastructure — in your actual repo.

📐 **Follows your architecture** — Steering files (`.kiro/steering/*.md`) define module boundaries, build commands, and rules the agent must follow.

🔧 **Grows capabilities** — MCP plugins extend what the agent can do: Discord operations, image/video generation, any API you need.

⏰ **Works autonomously** — Cron schedules let the agent check servers, run reports, and automate DevOps on autopilot.

📈 **Gets stronger over time** — Memory + steering + conversation history + MCP tools compound. Day 1 it's helpful. Day 30 it's your team member.

### Train your agent

```
Day 1  — Bind a project, agent starts learning your codebase
         !start /home/user/my-project

Day 3  — Teach it your rules
         !memory add Always respond in Traditional Chinese
         !memory add Commit messages in English, conventional commits format

Day 7  — Add steering files for architecture boundaries
         .kiro/steering/project.md → build commands, module rules, never-do list

Day 14 — Set up autonomous schedules
         /cron → Daily 9am server health check, compare with yesterday

Day 30 — Extend capabilities with MCP plugins
         Discord MCP → agent reads messages, sends notifications across channels
         Media MCP → agent generates images, videos, music, speech
```

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- [kiro-cli](https://cli.kiro.dev/install) 1.29+ installed
- kiro-cli authenticated via one of:
  - `kiro-cli login` (interactive, opens browser)
  - `KIRO_API_KEY` environment variable (headless / server deployments)
- A Discord bot token with the following:
  - Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
  - Permissions: View Channels, Send Messages, Add Reactions, Read Message History
  - Privileged Intents: **Message Content Intent** enabled

---

### 1. Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → New Application
2. **Bot** tab → Reset Token → copy the token
3. **Bot** tab → Privileged Gateway Intents → enable **Message Content Intent**
4. **OAuth2** tab → URL Generator → select scopes: `bot` + `applications.commands`
5. Select permissions: View Channels, Send Messages, Add Reactions, Read Message History
6. Open the generated URL to invite the bot to your server
7. Note your **Guild ID** (right-click server → Copy Server ID, requires Developer Mode)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Make sure the **Interactions Endpoint URL** field (under General Information) is **empty**. If a URL is set there, Discord will send slash command interactions to that URL instead of the bot's gateway connection, and all `/` commands will fail with "application did not respond in time".

---

### 2. Install kiro-cli

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.kiro.dev/install | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**Authentication** — choose one:

```bash
# Option A: Interactive login (opens browser)
kiro-cli login

# Option B: API key (headless / server — set in .env)
# Get your key from https://kiro.dev/settings → API Keys
# Then add KIRO_API_KEY=your-key to .env
```

---

### 3. Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nczz/kiro-discord-bot.git
cd kiro-discord-bot

cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

---

### 4. Build

```bash
VERSION=$(git describe --tags --always 2>/dev/null || echo "dev")
go build -ldflags "-X main.Version=$VERSION" -o kiro-discord-bot .
```

---

### 5. Start with systemd (recommended)

Install the service (edit paths in the file to match your setup):

```bash
# System-level (root)
sudo cp kiro-discord-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now kiro-discord-bot

# Or user-level (non-root)
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp kiro-discord-bot.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
# Edit WorkingDirectory and EnvironmentFile paths
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now kiro-discord-bot
```

Manage:

```bash
systemctl status kiro-discord-bot     # check status
journalctl -u kiro-discord-bot -f     # follow logs
systemctl restart kiro-discord-bot    # restart
systemctl stop kiro-discord-bot       # stop
```

> For user-level services, add `--user` to all `systemctl` and `journalctl` commands.

---

### 6. Start manually

```bash
# Load .env and run in foreground
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
./kiro-discord-bot
```

---

### 7. Deploy with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Run the release preflight before restarting an existing service:

```bash
scripts/release-preflight.sh
```

For a local authenticated ACP smoke test:

```bash
RUN_ACP_SMOKE=1 KIRO_CLI=/Users/chun/.local/bin/kiro-cli scripts/release-preflight.sh
```

See `docs/release.md` for the full release and deployment checklist.

`docker-compose.yml` uses `network_mode: host` and mounts `~/.kiro` so the bot inherits your kiro login and MCP settings.
The runtime image installs `kiro-cli` during build and defaults `KIRO_CLI_PATH` to `/root/.local/bin/kiro-cli`. For offline or pinned deployments, build your own runtime image with the desired `kiro-cli` version and keep `KIRO_CLI_PATH` aligned.

---

### 8. Grant Channel Permissions

The bot needs explicit permission in each channel it should respond to:

1. Right-click the channel → Edit Channel → Permissions
2. Add the bot role/user
3. Enable: View Channel, Send Messages, Add Reactions, Read Message History

---

## Usage

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start <cwd>` | Bind channel to a project directory and start agent |
| `/reset` | Restart the agent for this channel |
| `/status` | Show agent state, queue length, context usage, session ID |
| `/usage [user]` | Show credit usage for today, this week, and month-to-date |
| `/doctor` | Run deployment diagnostics and ACP preflight |
| `/audit [limit]` | Show recent raw/semantic audit events for the current channel or thread |
| `/cancel` | Cancel the currently running task |
| `/interrupt` | Interrupt a stuck current task; starts with `/cancel`, then tries a process interrupt if still active |
| `/cwd` | Show current working directory |
| `/pause` | Switch the channel to mention-only inline mode for new tasks |
| `/back` | Resume full-listen mode and enable new task threads |
| `/thread [on|off]` | Show or set whether new channel tasks open Discord threads |
| `/silent` | Show silent mode status (compact tool output, default: on) |
| `/silent on` | Enable compact tool output |
| `/silent off` | Show full tool details |
| `/model` | Show current model |
| `/model <model-id>` | Switch model (dynamic switch, no restart if supported) |
| `/models` | List all available models |
| `/agent` | List available agent modes |
| `/agent <mode-id>` | Switch agent mode (for example `kiro_default`, `kiro_planner`, `kiro_guide`) |
| `/cron` | Add a scheduled task (opens form) |
| `/cron-list` | List scheduled tasks with action buttons |
| `/cron-run <name>` | Manually run a scheduled task |
| `/cron-prompt <description>` | Create a scheduled task using natural language |
| `/remind <time> <content>` | Set a one-time reminder (tags you when due) |
| `/compact` | Compress conversation history to free context |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation history |
| `/close-thread <thread_id>` | Close an inactive thread agent in this channel scope |
| `/memory` | Manage persistent memory rules (add/list/remove/clear) |
| `/flashmemory` | Manage session-scoped flash memory (add/list/remove/clear) |

All commands also work with `!` prefix (e.g. `!status`, `!reset`).

When a command is used inside a Discord thread, it targets the thread agent when that is the least surprising behavior: `/status`, `/reset`, `/cancel`, `/interrupt`, `/compact`, `/clear`, and `/model` operate on the current thread agent. `/pause`, `/back`, and `/silent` apply to the current target, so a thread can override the listen behavior captured when it was created. `/thread` always applies to the parent channel's future new-task behavior. `/memory` and `/flashmemory` remain scoped to the parent channel because thread agents inherit that memory block.

Channel setup and scheduling commands must be run in the parent channel: `/start`, `/cwd`, `/agent`, `/resume`, `/cron`, `/cron-list`, `/cron-run`, `/cron-prompt`, and `/remind`.

**Thread-only commands** (inside a thread):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!close` | Close the thread agent |
| `!cancel` | Cancel the thread agent's current task |
| `!interrupt` | Interrupt the thread agent's stuck current task |
| `!reset` | Restart the thread agent |
| `!pause` | Switch thread to mention-only mode |
| `!back` | Resume thread full-listen mode |
| `!thread [on\|off]` | Show or set whether new parent-channel tasks open Discord threads |
| `!silent` | Show thread silent mode status |
| `!silent on` | Enable compact tool output in this thread |
| `!silent off` | Show full tool details in this thread |
| `!compact` | Compress thread agent's conversation history |
| `!clear` | Clear thread agent's conversation history |
| `!close-thread <thread_id>` | Close an inactive thread agent in the parent channel scope |
| `!model` | Show thread agent's current model |
| `!model <model-id>` | Switch thread agent's model |
| `!models` | List all available models |
| `!audit [limit]` | Show recent audit events for this thread |

All thread commands also work as `/` slash commands inside a thread.

### Sending Tasks

**Full-listen mode (default):** Any message in the channel is sent to the agent. When peer bot discovery finds another bot that can respond in the current channel or thread, including through inherited permissions, that target automatically switches to mention-only behavior to prevent bot-to-bot loops.

**Mention mode (after `/pause` or automatic multi-bot mode):** Only `@BotName your message` triggers the agent. Use a real Discord mention such as `<@111111111111111111>` or pick the bot from Discord's mention UI; plain text like `@BuildBot` may not trigger the target bot. In a parent channel, `/pause` also disables new task threads so mentioned work replies in-channel with emoji progress; `/back` restores full-listen mode and enables new task threads again.

Use `/back` or `!back` on the target bot to open full-listen mode for that channel and enable future task threads, even when multi-bot mode made mention-only the default. A thread can still override its own listen behavior with `/pause` or `!pause`, and can return to full-listen with thread-local `/back` or `!back`.

**Thread mode:** By default, each parent-channel task automatically creates a Discord Thread from your message. Tool execution status and the final response are posted in the thread, keeping the main channel clean. `/thread off` or parent-channel `/pause` stops opening new threads; new tasks must mention the bot, run on the channel's main agent, show progress by rotating reactions such as `🔄`, `💭`, `✨`, `🛠️`, and `⚙️`, then post only the final reply in the channel. `/thread on` or parent-channel `/back` restores new task threads.

**Thread discussions:** You can continue chatting with the agent inside any thread. A dedicated agent is spawned per thread with the original task context injected. Thread agents are independent from the main channel agent, so both can work in parallel. A thread keeps the listen mode captured when it was created; changing the parent channel's thread mode later does not silently change old threads. Manually created or unknown threads under `/thread off` default to mention-only until overridden in that thread. Inactive thread agents are automatically closed after idle timeout (`THREAD_AGENT_IDLE_SEC`) or when an inactive thread is archived. Capacity limits never close thread agents automatically: if all slots are full, the bot reports active/inactive counts and lists inactive candidates so a user can choose which one to close with `/close-thread thread_id:<id>`. Active work is never evicted by idle cleanup, archive events, or capacity limits; archived active threads are closed after the current job returns to idle. Use `!close` in a thread to manually close its agent.

**Cancel vs interrupt:** `/cancel` sends ACP `session/cancel` for the current task. `/interrupt` first does the same soft cancel, waits briefly, and only if the same task is still active tries `SIGINT` on the agent process group so a stuck tool subprocess can be interrupted. A repeated `/interrupt` on the same still-running task can try another `SIGINT`. It does not clear persisted session metadata or close the Discord thread; if the agent exits, the manager's normal restart/load path handles the next message.

**Multi-bot handoff:** Peer bots are auto-discovered from Discord guild bot members at startup using the full guild member list, including their bot role when available. `BOT_PEERS` is only needed to override a discovered name/role, add a bot that discovery cannot see, or exclude an unrelated bot with `!userID`. Automatic multi-bot mention-only mode applies when another peer bot can effectively respond in the current channel or thread, whether that means sending in the channel or creating a public thread and replying there. That access may come from an explicit channel overwrite, inherited role permissions, or `@everyone`. User mentions such as `<@111111111111111111>` and discovered or configured role mentions such as `<@&222222222222222222>` both route to the target bot. Bot-authored messages are ignored by default; a peer bot handoff is only accepted inside a thread when the target bot is explicitly mentioned, the original task message already has the done reaction (`✅`), and the message is not just progress, error, timeout, or empty output. Normal thread tasks include recent Discord thread messages as bounded context. Accepted cross-bot handoffs include a longer thread transcript as handoff context, so the receiving bot can understand the task, prior decisions, files, results, and remaining work before acting. This lets one bot ask another bot to continue work after the first bot has finished, without responding to every intermediate status update.

Run `/doctor` in the target channel or thread to verify Discord permissions, configured peers, and whether the current context is open, open by `/back` override, or automatic multi-bot mention-only mode.

Slash commands are registered at guild scope, but the bot rejects command invocations in channels or threads where its Discord user cannot view and respond. To hide commands from Discord's command picker as well, configure application command permissions for the app in Discord or through an OAuth2 token with `applications.commands.permissions.update`.

### Status Indicators

| Reaction | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| ⏳ | Queued |
| 🔄 | Processing |
| ⚙️ | Running a tool |
| ✅ | Done |
| ❌ | Error |
| ⚠️ | Timed out |

### Thread Visibility

Each task runs in a Discord thread. The bot posts the full work process in real-time:

| Event | Display |
|-------|---------|
| Tool start | Kind icon (📖 read, ✏️ edit, ▶️ execute, 🔍 search, 🌐 fetch) + title + affected files |
| Tool result | Full output in code block (up to 1900 chars per message) |
| Tool failure | ❌ title + error output |
| Agent thinking | 💭 thought content |
| Final response | Complete text, auto-split if > 2000 chars |

**Silent mode** (default: on) shows compact output. Tool start messages show only an icon plus a short title, execute commands show a short escaped prefix such as `Running: ssh n200 ...`, tool results and thoughts are hidden, and failures show a one-line summary. Use `/silent off` for full detail. `/silent` without an argument only shows the current status. Silent mode is stored in memory only, so it resets to on after the bot restarts. Threads have their own silent setting and do not inherit a parent channel's `/silent off`.

### Recovery

If a response is cut off, use `!resume` to re-post the agent's last output.

---

## Optional: Discord MCP Server

This project includes a built-in Discord MCP Server (`cmd/mcp-discord/`) that gives the kiro agent direct access to Discord — read messages, send messages, list channels, search, add reactions, etc.

Once enabled, the agent can proactively interact with Discord instead of only responding to forwarded messages.

### Additional Permissions for MCP

The MCP server uses Discord REST APIs beyond what the base bot needs. Before enabling, add these to your bot:

**Extra Bot Permissions:**
- Attach Files — `discord_send_file`
- Embed Links — `discord_send_embed`
- Manage Messages — `discord_delete_message`, `discord_pin_message`, `discord_remove_reaction`
- Create Public Threads — `discord_create_thread`
- Manage Channels — `discord_edit_channel_topic`

**Extra Privileged Intent:**
- **Server Members Intent** — required by `discord_list_members`

> Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → your app → **Bot** tab to enable the intent, and regenerate the OAuth2 invite URL with the additional permissions.

### Safety Scope

Set MCP allowlists before enabling the server in a workspace with broad Discord access:

```env
MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILDS=123456789012345678
MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNELS=234567890123456789,345678901234567890
MCP_DISCORD_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/tmp/kiro-discord-mcp
MCP_DISCORD_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=false
```

When a guild allowlist is set, channel tools resolve the channel and reject channels outside allowed guilds. When a channel allowlist is set, channel and thread tools only operate on those IDs. `discord_download_attachment` only downloads from Discord attachment/CDN hosts; `MCP_DISCORD_DOWNLOAD_DIR` restricts where files can be written.

For stricter deployments, set `MCP_DISCORD_READ_ONLY=true` to block every write tool, or set `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_WRITE_TOOLS` to a comma-separated list such as `discord_send_message,discord_reply_message`. Set `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=false` to block delete/edit/pin/topic/reaction-removal operations while still allowing non-destructive sends.

### Quick Install

```bash
# 1. Build the MCP server binary
go build -o mcp-discord-server ./cmd/mcp-discord/

# 2. Install the steering file (global, so it works in any project directory)
mkdir -p ~/.kiro/steering
cp .kiro/steering/discord-mcp.md ~/.kiro/steering/discord-mcp.md

# 3. Register in kiro MCP settings
# Add the following to ~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json under "mcpServers":
```

```json
"mcp-discord": {
  "command": "sh",
  "args": [
    "-c",
    "set -a && . /absolute/path/to/kiro-discord-bot/.env && exec /absolute/path/to/kiro-discord-bot/mcp-discord-server"
  ]
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/kiro-discord-bot` with the actual project directory.

```bash
# 4. Restart the agent session
# Use /reset or !reset in Discord
```

### Auto-Install via Agent

You can also ask the agent to install it by sending this message in Discord:

> Read INSTALL_MCP.md and follow the steps to install the Discord MCP server.

The agent will read the guide, build the binary, update `mcp.json`, and prompt you to restart.

### Available Tools (after enabled)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `discord_list_channels` | List text channels in a guild |
| `discord_read_messages` | Read recent messages from a channel |
| `discord_send_message` | Send a message to a channel |
| `discord_reply_message` | Reply to a specific message |
| `discord_add_reaction` | Add a reaction emoji to a message |
| `discord_list_members` | List members of a guild |
| `discord_search_messages` | Search recent messages by keyword |
| `discord_channel_info` | Get detailed info about a channel |
| `discord_send_file` | Upload a local file to a channel as an attachment |
| `discord_list_attachments` | List file attachments from recent messages |
| `discord_download_attachment` | Download a Discord attachment to a local file |
| `discord_edit_message` | Edit a message |
| `discord_delete_message` | Delete a message |
| `discord_get_message` | Get a single message by ID |

## Notes

- **Session persistence:** Channel and thread agents persist ACP session IDs in `DATA_DIR/sessions.json`. When kiro-cli advertises `loadSession`, bot restart first tries `session/load` for the stored ACP session. If loading is unavailable or fails, the bot creates a new session and injects recent JSONL/Discord conversation history into the first prompt. Stored session keys are scoped by guild, bot identity, target type, and target ID; legacy channel-only keys are still read as a migration fallback.
- **MCP servers:** Inherited from `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` automatically. Note: ACP `session/new` mcpServers field is currently ignored by kiro-cli ([#7349](https://github.com/kirodotdev/Kiro/issues/7349)).
- **Discord MCP scope:** Use `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILDS` and `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNELS` before exposing tools to broad workspaces. Use `MCP_DISCORD_READ_ONLY`, `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_WRITE_TOOLS`, or `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=false` to restrict write tools. Empty allowlists preserve unrestricted legacy behavior.
- **Project steering:** Add `.kiro/steering/*.md` in the project directory or `~/.kiro/steering/` globally to guide agent behavior.
- **CWD allowlist:** Set `ALLOWED_CWD_ROOTS` to restrict all agent working directories to approved roots. Docker defaults this to `/projects`.
- **Long responses:** Automatically split into multiple messages at 2000 char Discord limit.
- **Conversation logs:** All user/agent interactions are recorded in `DATA_DIR/ch-<channelID>/chat.jsonl`.
- **Raw Discord audit DB:** Bot-visible Discord events are recorded independently in SQLite at `DATA_DIR/audit/discord.sqlite` by default. The audit recorder stores append-only `discord_events` rows plus query projections for messages, attachments, reactions, and threads. It also records semantic bot events such as command invocations, command responses, agent job lifecycle, and agent final responses in `bot_audit_events`. High-volume typing-start events are disabled by default. Audit data does not trigger the agent and is never injected into conversation context unless an explicit command or future tool reads it.
- **Audit permissions:** `/audit` and `!audit` use Discord effective channel permissions instead of a separate ACL. The caller must be able to manage the current target channel/thread, either directly or through the parent channel for threads. Discord permission changes take effect on the next audit query.
- **Attachments:** Stored in `DATA_DIR/ch-<channelID>/attachments/` with timestamp prefixes. Filenames are sanitized, downloads must return HTTP 200, and each file is capped by `ATTACHMENT_MAX_MB`. Auto-cleaned after `ATTACHMENT_RETAIN_DAYS`.
- **Tool permissions:** Server-initiated ACP permission requests are approved only when `TRUST_ALL_TOOLS=true` or `TRUST_TOOLS` is set; otherwise they are denied by local policy.
- **Preflight:** `PREFLIGHT_MODE=warn` keeps the bot online when `kiro-cli` is temporarily unavailable. Use `strict` for fail-fast production startup or `skip` for development.
- **Thread agents:** Idle timeout respects active work — cleanup skips workers with an active job, and `lastActivity` is updated during tool execution. Set `THREAD_AGENT_IDLE_SEC=0` to disable thread idle cleanup. `THREAD_AGENT_MAX` must be greater than zero and is a hard safety limit; capacity overflow asks the user to close an inactive thread with `/close-thread thread_id:<id>` instead of auto-evicting one.
- **Channel agent idle:** Set `CHANNEL_AGENT_IDLE_SEC` (default `0` = disabled) to auto-close idle channel agents and free resources. Agents restart automatically on next message.
- **Cron jobs:** Definitions in `DATA_DIR/cron/cron.json`, execution history in `DATA_DIR/cron/<jobID>/history.jsonl` (includes full agent output).

## 中文說明

**一個住在 Discord 裡的可訓練 AI agent — 綁定你的 codebase、記住你的規矩、越用越強。**

### 這不是聊天機器人

一般 AI bot 每次對話都從零開始。kiro-discord-bot 不同：

🧠 **會記住** — 永久記憶規則讓 agent 記住你的偏好、coding style、專案規範，跨 session 永久生效。

⚡ **能聚焦** — 閃存記憶讓你針對當前任務設定重點強調，用完即丟不污染未來 session。

📂 **懂你的 code** — 每個頻道綁定一個專案目錄，agent 能讀寫程式碼、跑測試、操作基礎設施。

📐 **遵守架構** — Steering 文件（`.kiro/steering/*.md`）定義模組邊界、build 指令、禁止事項。

🔧 **能擴充** — MCP 插件擴展 agent 能力：Discord 操作、圖片/影片生成、任何 API。

⏰ **會自己做事** — Cron 排程讓 agent 定時巡檢伺服器、跑報告、自動化維運。

📈 **越用越強** — Memory + Steering + 對話歷史 + MCP 工具持續累積。第一天它能幫忙，第三十天它是你的隊友。

### 養成你的 Agent

```
Day 1  — 綁定專案，agent 開始認識你的 codebase
         !start /home/user/my-project

Day 3  — 教它你的規矩
         !memory add 永遠用繁體中文回答
         !memory add commit message 一律用英文，遵循 conventional commits

Day 7  — 加入 steering 文件，定義專案架構邊界
         .kiro/steering/project.md → build 指令、模組規則、禁止事項

Day 14 — 設定自動化排程
         /cron → 每天 9 點檢查伺服器健康狀態，跟昨天比較

Day 30 — 擴充能力
         Discord MCP → agent 能主動讀訊息、發通知、跨頻道協作
         Media MCP → agent 能生成圖片、影片、音樂、語音
```

### 部署

#### 前置需求

- Go 1.21+
- 已安裝 [kiro-cli](https://cli.kiro.dev/install) 1.29+
- kiro-cli 驗證方式（擇一）：
  - `kiro-cli login`（互動式，開啟瀏覽器）
  - `KIRO_API_KEY` 環境變數（headless / 伺服器部署）
- Discord bot token，需具備：
  - Scopes：`bot`、`applications.commands`
  - 權限：查看頻道、發送訊息、新增反應、讀取訊息歷史
  - Privileged Intents：啟用 **Message Content Intent**

> ⚠️ **重要：** 請確認 Discord Developer Portal → General Information 中的 **Interactions Endpoint URL** 欄位為**空白**。若該欄位有設定 URL，Discord 會將 slash command 的 interaction 送往該 URL 而非 bot 的 gateway 連線，導致所有 `/` 指令出現「該應用程式未及時回應」錯誤。

### 快速開始

```bash
# 1. 安裝 kiro-cli
curl -fsSL https://cli.kiro.dev/install | bash

# 驗證方式擇一：
kiro-cli login                    # 互動式（開瀏覽器）
# 或在 .env 中設定 KIRO_API_KEY   # headless（伺服器推薦）

# 2. 設定環境變數
cp .env.example .env
# 編輯 .env，填入 DISCORD_TOKEN、DISCORD_GUILD_ID、KIRO_CLI_PATH 等

# 3. 編譯
VERSION=$(git describe --tags --always 2>/dev/null || echo "dev")
go build -ldflags "-X main.Version=$VERSION" -o kiro-discord-bot .

# 4. 啟動（擇一）
# systemd（推薦）：
sudo cp kiro-discord-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now kiro-discord-bot

# 手動：
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
./kiro-discord-bot
```

既有服務重啟前，先跑 release preflight：

```bash
scripts/release-preflight.sh
```

若要包含本機已登入的 ACP smoke test：

```bash
RUN_ACP_SMOKE=1 KIRO_CLI=/Users/chun/.local/bin/kiro-cli scripts/release-preflight.sh
```

完整升版與部署檢查表見 `docs/release.md`。

### 指令說明

| 指令 | 說明 |

| `/status` | 查詢 agent 狀態、queue 長度、context 使用率 |
| `/usage [user]` | 查詢今天、本周、本月至今 credits 用量 |
| `/doctor` | 執行部署診斷與 ACP preflight |
| `/audit [limit]` | 查看目前頻道或討論串最近的 raw/semantic 稽核事件 |
| `/cancel` | 取消目前執行中的任務 |
| `/interrupt` | 中斷卡住的目前任務；先執行取消，仍未結束才嘗試進程層中斷 |
| `/cwd` | 查詢目前工作目錄 |
| `/pause` | 切換頻道為 @mention 原頻道回覆模式 |
| `/back` | 恢復完整監聽並啟用新任務討論串 |
| `/thread [on|off]` | 查詢或設定新的頻道任務是否開啟 Discord 討論串 |
| `/silent` | 查詢安靜模式狀態（精簡工具輸出，預設：開啟） |
| `/silent on` | 開啟精簡工具輸出 |
| `/silent off` | 顯示完整工具細節 |
| `/model` | 查詢目前使用的 model |
| `/model <model-id>` | 切換 model 並重啟 agent |
| `/models` | 列出所有可用的 model |
| `/cron` | 新增排程任務（開啟表單） |
| `/cron-list` | 列出排程任務（含操作按鈕） |

| `/flashmemory` | 管理 session 閃存記憶（add/list/remove/clear） |

所有指令也支援 `!` 前綴（如 `!status`、`!reset`）。

在 Discord 討論串中使用指令時，會依最符合直覺的作用範圍執行：`/status`、`/reset`、`/cancel`、`/interrupt`、`/compact`、`/clear`、`/model` 會操作目前的討論串 agent。`/pause`、`/back`、`/silent` 會套用在目前目標，因此討論串可以覆蓋建立當下保存的監聽行為。`/thread` 永遠套用在父頻道未來新任務是否開討論串。`/memory` 與 `/flashmemory` 仍套用在父層頻道，因為討論串 agent 會繼承父層記憶。

頻道設定與排程指令必須在父層頻道使用：`/start`、`/cwd`、`/agent`、`/resume`、`/cron`、`/cron-list`、`/cron-run`、`/cron-prompt`、`/remind`。

**討論串專用指令**（在 thread 中使用）：

| 指令 | 說明 |
|------|------|
| `!close` | 關閉討論串 agent |
| `!cancel` | 取消討論串 agent 目前的任務 |

| `!models` | 列出所有可用的 model |
| `!audit [limit]` | 查看此討論串最近的稽核事件 |

所有討論串指令也支援 `/` slash command 形式。

### 注意事項

- Bot 需要在各 channel 的權限設定中明確授予讀寫權限
- Session ID 會存到 `DATA_DIR/sessions.json`；當 kiro-cli 宣告支援 `loadSession` 時，頻道與討論串 agent 重啟會優先用 `session/load` 接回既有 ACP session。Session key 會依 guild、bot 身分、目標類型與 channel/thread ID 分開；舊版 channel-only key 仍會作為遷移 fallback 讀取
- MCP 設定自動繼承 `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`
- **Discord MCP 範圍**：用 `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILDS`、`MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNELS` 限制可操作的 guild/channel；用 `MCP_DISCORD_READ_ONLY`、`MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_WRITE_TOOLS` 或 `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=false` 限制寫入工具
- **Raw Discord 稽核資料庫**：bot 可見的 Discord events 會獨立寫入 SQLite（預設 `DATA_DIR/audit/discord.sqlite`），包含 append-only `discord_events` 與 messages、attachments、reactions、threads 查詢投影；也會在 `bot_audit_events` 紀錄 command 呼叫、command 回覆、agent job lifecycle、agent final response 等語意事件。高頻 typing-start event 預設不紀錄。這不會觸發 agent，也不會自動注入 agent 對話 context；現有 `chat.jsonl` 仍只紀錄實際 user/agent 互動。
- **稽核權限**：`/audit` 與 `!audit` 直接使用 Discord effective channel permissions，不另建 ACL。呼叫者必須能管理目前目標頻道或討論串；討論串會接受父層頻道管理權限。Discord 權限異動會在下一次查詢即時生效。
- 回應被截斷時可用 `!resume` 補完
- **討論串模式**：預設新的父頻道任務會由 bot 主動開 Discord thread，過程與最終回覆都在 thread 中。`/thread off` 或父頻道 `/pause` 會停止新任務開 thread；新任務必須 @mention bot，使用頻道主 agent，在原頻道以 `🔄`、`💭`、`✨`、`🛠️`、`⚙️` 等 reaction heartbeat 顯示仍在運作，最後才送出實際回覆。`/thread on` 或父頻道 `/back` 會恢復新任務開 thread。
- **討論串互動**：在 bot 建立的 thread 中發訊息，會自動啟動獨立的 thread agent 接續討論。thread 會保存建立當下的監聽模式；父頻道後續切換 `/thread off` 不會讓舊 thread 被動改成 mention-only。若父頻道已是 `/thread off`，手動建立或未知來源的 thread 預設 mention-only，直到在該 thread 內 `/back`。非 active agent 閒置超過 `THREAD_AGENT_IDLE_SEC` 或非 active thread 歸檔時自動關閉，再次發訊息可重新啟動。容量上限不會自動關閉任何 thread agent；如果名額已滿，bot 會列出 active/inactive 狀態與 inactive 候選，讓使用者執行 `/close-thread thread_id:<id>` 關閉指定 inactive agent。active work 不會因 idle cleanup、歸檔事件或 thread agent 容量上限被強制終止；active thread 若被歸檔，會在目前 job 回到 idle 後關閉；`THREAD_AGENT_IDLE_SEC=0` 可停用討論串閒置清理。
- **取消與中斷**：`/cancel` 只送出 ACP `session/cancel` 取消目前任務；`/interrupt` 會先做同樣的 soft cancel，短暫等待後若同一任務仍在執行，才嘗試對 agent process group 送 `SIGINT`，用來中斷卡住的工具子程序。若同一任務仍卡住，重複 `/interrupt` 可再嘗試一次 `SIGINT`。它不會清除已保存的 session metadata，也不會關閉 Discord thread；若 agent 因中斷退出，下一則訊息會走既有的重啟與 `session/load` 流程
- **多 bot 模式**：bot 啟動時會用完整 Discord guild member list 自動偵測同 server 內其他 bot，並盡量補上 bot role。`BOT_PEERS` 只需要用來覆蓋偵測結果、補上偵測不到的 bot、手動加入 role-only peer，或用 `!userID` 排除無關 bot；格式為 `Name:userID`、`Name:userID:roleID`、`Name::roleID` 或 `!userID`。自動 multi-bot mention-only 會在另一個 peer bot 對目前頻道或討論串具有實際可回應權限時啟用，包含直接在頻道發訊息，或建立公開討論串並在討論串內回覆；權限來源可以是明確 channel overwrite、繼承 role 權限或 `@everyone` 權限。自動偵測到的 role-only peer 仍不會單獨觸發 mention-only，除非用 `BOT_PEERS=Name::roleID` 手動指定。請用真正的 Discord mention（例如 `<@111111111111111111>` 或 Discord 介面的提及選單），若偵測或設定了 role ID，role mention（例如 `<@&222222222222222222>`）也會路由到目標 bot；純文字 `@BuildBot` 不一定會觸發。若要讓其中一個 bot 暫時恢復完整監聽，對該 bot 在主頻道執行 `/back` 或 `!back`，該主頻道底下的討論串也會繼承；若只想讓某條討論串回到 mention-only，可在該討論串執行 `/pause` 或 `!pause`
- **Bot 交接限制**：bot 產生的訊息預設不會觸發另一個 bot。只有在討論串內、明確 tag 目標 bot、原始任務訊息已有完成反應（`✅`），且內容不是進度、錯誤、逾時或空輸出時，才會被視為有效交接。一般討論串任務會帶入近期 Discord 討論串訊息作為 bounded context；通過 gate 的跨 bot 交接會帶入較長的 thread transcript 作為 handoff context，讓被交辦 bot 先掌握任務、先前決策、相關檔案、結果與剩餘工作
- **Slash command 範圍**：指令以 guild scope 註冊，但 bot 會拒絕在自己沒有讀寫權限的頻道或討論串中執行。若要讓 Discord 指令選單也隱藏該 bot 的指令，需要在 Discord app command permissions 設定，或用具備 `applications.commands.permissions.update` scope 的 OAuth2 token 同步權限
- **部署診斷**：在目標頻道或討論串執行 `/doctor`，可確認 Discord 權限、`BOT_PEERS` 設定，以及目前是開放模式、`/back` override 開放模式，或自動多 bot mention-only 模式
- **頻道 agent 閒置回收**：設定 `CHANNEL_AGENT_IDLE_SEC`（預設 `0` = 停用）可讓閒置的頻道 agent 自動關閉以釋放資源，下次發訊息時自動重啟

---

### 選配：Discord MCP Server

本專案內建 Discord MCP Server（`cmd/mcp-discord/`），啟用後 kiro agent 可直接操作 Discord——讀訊息、發訊息、列頻道、搜尋、加反應等。

#### MCP 額外權限需求

MCP server 使用的 Discord REST API 超出 bot 本體所需，啟用前請先補上以下權限：

**額外 Bot 權限：**
- Attach Files — `discord_send_file`
- Embed Links — `discord_send_embed`
- Manage Messages — `discord_delete_message`、`discord_pin_message`、`discord_remove_reaction`
- Create Public Threads — `discord_create_thread`
- Manage Channels — `discord_edit_channel_topic`

**額外 Privileged Intent：**
- **Server Members Intent** — `discord_list_members` 需要

> 前往 [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → 你的應用 → **Bot** 頁籤啟用 intent，並重新產生含額外權限的 OAuth2 邀請連結。

#### 安全範圍

在有較大 Discord 存取權的 workspace 啟用 MCP 前，建議先設定 allowlist：

```env
MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_GUILDS=123456789012345678
MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_CHANNELS=234567890123456789,345678901234567890
MCP_DISCORD_DOWNLOAD_DIR=/tmp/kiro-discord-mcp
MCP_DISCORD_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=false
```

設定 guild allowlist 後，所有 channel 類工具都會先解析頻道並拒絕非授權 guild。設定 channel allowlist 後，頻道與 thread 類工具只允許指定 ID。`discord_download_attachment` 只接受 Discord attachment/CDN host；`MCP_DISCORD_DOWNLOAD_DIR` 會限制下載檔案可寫入的目錄。

更嚴格的部署可設定 `MCP_DISCORD_READ_ONLY=true` 封鎖所有寫入工具，或用 `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOWED_WRITE_TOOLS` 指定允許的寫入工具，例如 `discord_send_message,discord_reply_message`。設定 `MCP_DISCORD_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=false` 可阻擋刪除、編輯、釘選、改 topic、移除 reaction 等管理操作，同時保留非破壞性發訊息能力。

#### 手動安裝

```bash
# 1. 編譯 MCP server
go build -o mcp-discord-server ./cmd/mcp-discord/

# 2. 安裝 steering 文件（全域，讓任何專案目錄都能使用）
mkdir -p ~/.kiro/steering
cp .kiro/steering/discord-mcp.md ~/.kiro/steering/discord-mcp.md

# 3. 註冊到 kiro MCP 設定
# 在 ~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json 的 "mcpServers" 中加入：
```

```json
"mcp-discord": {
  "command": "sh",
  "args": [
    "-c",
    "set -a && . /你的專案絕對路徑/.env && exec /你的專案絕對路徑/mcp-discord-server"
  ]
}
```

將 `/你的專案絕對路徑` 替換為實際路徑。

```bash
# 4. 重啟 agent session
# 在 Discord 中使用 /reset 或 !reset
